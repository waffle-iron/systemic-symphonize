/**
 * Created by Adron on 1/6/14.
 * Description: Purpose of this code is for exporting, or "dispensing" the data
 *  to the designated write source.
 *
 * Note: for the write_to_orchestrate section to work you'll have to add a file
 *  called orchestrate_key.js for the calls against Orchestrate.io to work. The
 *  file needs to be placed in a directory called "key" and then add the appropriate
 *  key for access.
 *
 *  Check the README.md in the key directory for more information.

// Setup the database connection to orchestrate.io.
